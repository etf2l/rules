## 1.1. All players are welcome

Any player of any country is welcome to play in ETF2L. However, ETF2L reserves the right to exclude certain players from its competitions.

### 1.1.1. Only registered players are eligible

All players participating in matches must be registered on ETF2L. Using a player not registered on ETF2L will result in the match being defaulted in the opponent’s favour. A registered player that is not verified on a team’s roster before an official match’s start time (listed as unverified on the roster, or not on the roster at all), as displayed on the match page, counts as merc. Players are  verified after being rostered for 24 hours. Competition-specific merc clauses apply.

### 1.1.2. Any Form of Harassment/Racism/Toxicity/Etc is Punishable

ETF2L does not support any form of harassment of its players. People harassing others based on ethnicity, culture, religion or similar examples will get punished for their actions. We understand that things can get heated within a competitive game and we handle cases with this in mind. We ask you to remain as civil as possible when it comes to situations like this and to treat others with respect.

## 1.2. ETF2L Timezone = CET/CEST

ETF2L announces all times in either Central European Time (CET) or Central European Summer Time (CEST). A clock displaying the current time can be found on the homepage. All times and/or timestamps on the website are displayed in one of the two timezones.

---

## 1.3. Official matches have to be entered on ETF2L

All official matches are to be scheduled on ETF2L. Teams may only claim a Default Win if the match has been scheduled.

### 1.3.1. Separate schedule & match deadline for every match – Default Date for all matches

Every official match has its own schedule and match deadline. Both can be found on the official’s respective match page.

Default Dates for every match are set at the earliest possible time after the schedule deadline is over. Date proposals and match comments from both teams are taken into account in order to ensure the best compromise in case the proposals do not match. Default Dates are set automatically in the tiers using the Swiss system.

### 1.3.1.1. Only submitted playdays are used to generate the Default Date

Default Dates in regular seasons and playoffs stages are issued only using league rules, newsposts and playdays supplied by both teams. Any sort of schedule-related communication exchanged between players, teams and casters, or in private conversations with admins (including schedule proposals and notices of availability) is not valid and will be ignored when deciding Default Dates.

### 1.3.1.2. Matches can only be rescheduled by mutual agreement

A scheduled match can only be rescheduled within the match’s deadline once both teams have agreed to it.

### 1.3.1.3. Late matches are not allowed

Every match has to be played and submitted within its deadline, shown at the top of its match page. If results are not submitted before said deadline, both teams will receive no points and Minor Warnings will be issued. These warnings cannot be removed, even if the match is played at a later time and results are submitted. Late result submissions within a Swiss style competition are not possible.

---

## 1.4. Use the match comments to record agreements on mercs, servers and other cases

We encourage using the match comments to keep in touch with your opponents. Any agreement between two teams regarding the use of mercs or servers must be recorded on the relevant match page and cannot be retracted. Only Leaders and Deputies are given the authority to make decisions on these issues.

If your opponent allows a merc, you are expected to extend the same courtesy to them.

---

## 1.5. Roster locks

All competitions have a roster lock during which participating teams may not add new players to their rosters. Roster locks are at the start of the final week of the competition’s regular season /  group stage, unless specified differently for the competition. A competition’s roster lock is lifted once its wrap-up post is published.
